In the last 2 years, I have made the transition from programmer to technical team leader. I found myself unprepared in some ways for my new responsibilities. I knew how to improve my technical skills, but I wasn't sure how to get better at my newly required soft skills. Needless to say, I was very excited when I heard about Roy Osherove's book __Notes to a Software Team Leader__.

The book is spot on when it says "Most of us weren't taught how to do this type of work." We want to be good at it. Our teams and our software are depending on us being able to lead. This book provides advice for ever team leader on how to become a better leader. It gives practical and useful ideas about how to manage your time and efforts as well as how to interact with others.

One of the key themes in the book is learning. As a team leader you need to learn to be better in your role. A key facet of that is facilitating ways for your team to grow. The book examines how you can improve in these areas.

The book concludes with a series of essays from thought leaders in the software industry. Each other tells what they would like to say to someone who is brand new in a software team leadership position.

I was very pleased with the book. The information was useful and applicable. I am better equipped to do my job for having read it.
