So I had this idea. I had been using speed reading sites like Spreeder and Spritz. I found it to be a very helpful way to get through my daily reading list.The only problem was that at times I wanted to vary the speed at which I was reading.

So I decided to write an application that would serve as the speed reading and then connect it to my stationary bike to control the speed. I wrote the app in WPF. I connected my stationary bike to a DigiSpark. The DigiSpark connects to the PC as a USB keyboard.
