A friend once told me that when I type in front of people, I spell like a drunken toddler on a broken keyboard. For years, I've worked to hide my poor spelling ability by removing the errors with a spell check tool. 

But then I got a different idea. What if, instead of trying to remove all of my mistakes, I had the software add more. That way, you wouldn't know which spelling errors were mine and which ones were added by the software. 

That is when [www.DrunkenToddlerBrokenKeyboard.com](http://www.DrunkenToddlerBrokenKeyboard.com) was born.
